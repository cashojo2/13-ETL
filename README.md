# 13-ETL

This project involves building an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas. Data was extracted from multiple input files and cleaned and structured using Python. A PostgreSQL database was constructed, and the transformed data was uploaded using pgAdmin.

The project resulted in four CSV files containing the transformed data, along with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema for the database. The successful integration of the data into PostgreSQL demonstrates a streamlined workflow for data management and analysis.
